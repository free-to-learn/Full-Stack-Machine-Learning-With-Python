# Full-Stack-Machine-Learning-With-Python

Machine learning methods are commonly used across engineering and sciences, from computer systems to physics. Moreover, commercial sites such as search engines, recommender systems (e.g., Netflix, Amazon), advertisers, and financial institutions employ machine learning algorithms for content recommendation, predicting customer behaviour, compliance, or risk.

As a discipline, machine learning tries to design and understand computer programs that learn from the experience for the purpose of prediction or control.

In this course, students will learn about principles and algorithms for turning training data into effective automated predictions. We will cover:

Machine Learning is making the computer learn from studying data and statistics. Machine Learning is a step in the direction of artificial intelligence (AI). Machine Learning is a program that analyses data and learns to predict the outcome, we will go back to mathematics and study statistics, and how to calculate important numbers based on data sets. We will also learn how to use various Python modules to get the answers we need.
