# Full-Stack-Machine-Learning-With-Python
Machine Learning is making the computer learn from studying data and statistics.  Machine Learning is a step into the direction of artificial intelligence (AI).  Machine Learning is a program that analyses data and learns to predict the outcome,we will go back to mathematics and study statistics, and how to calculate important numbers based on data sets.  We will also learn how to use various Python modules to get the answers we need.
